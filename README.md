## Hi 👋 I'm Subhash Kumar Dangi
<br></br>
I am a BCA graduate with strong hands-on knowledge in Java, Spring Boot, Swagger, Redis, MySQL, Git & GitHub, and Android development & UI/UX design.
I enjoy building scalable backend systems and intuitive mobile applications, and I’ve successfully created real-world projects that reflect my skills, problem-solving ability, and passion for clean, efficient code.

I’m always eager to learn new technologies and contribute to impactful projects in the software development space.
